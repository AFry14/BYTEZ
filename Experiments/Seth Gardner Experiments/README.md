Seth Gardner's Experiment Directory

This directory contains experiments that I have worked on to get ready to do the back-end part of our project.

Experiment 1
*This is the basic experiment to practice spring-boot.
*The experiment uses a person class to practice sending POST, GET, PUT and DELETE requests.
*Postman was used to send data as a client.
*In memory DB was used to store information.
*Dependancy Injection was set-up but not used.
